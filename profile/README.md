# Cassandra Artificial Intelligence Group
Cassandra AI is a small group of students aiming to share their knowledge freely to everyone. We hold meetings about SOTA topics and methods in different areas of Deep/machine learning such as Explainability, Computer Vision, Speech, Geometric DL and more. Our biggest dream is to build a model capable of distinguishing between muffins and chihuahuas.
